# Changelog

## 0.1.2

- Accept both automatic and sender-driven recovery in `compaction_setup_durable_once`: an interrupted run resumes through a new send on the same session without repeating Setup.
- Check that the held model request preserves the recovered summary and kept messages, including message ids, content and ordering, with only the resume user's message appended.
- Exercise both recovery shapes, repeated Setup on a resume send, changed kept content, and unexpected recovery states in the suite's fake-runner tests.

## 0.1.1

- Add the optional controlled retention clock for conformance subjects, so long retention cases run without wall-clock delays; cases without the controlled retention clock skip waits longer than 30 seconds and report the skipped case by name.
