# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Report collateral red-test counts and sorted, unique binary/target identities
  on proof rows, including zero collateral. Preserve Cargo headers alongside
  test events and retain nextest binary attribution in the shared parser.
- Grade catches with collateral outside all expected-test targets as
  `CAUGHT_BROADLY`; warn in row and summary output while still recording proofs
  and succeeding. Same-target collateral retains `CAUGHT`; `only` remains strict.
- Record reasoned `UNREACHABLE` dispositions in catalogues, exploration results,
  and reports, with a separate console listing and no caught credit.
- Keep the existing unversioned TOML catalogue and JSON report-array formats;
  `collateral` is additive report data. Previous catalogue rows remain readable.

## 0.1.0

- Replay, prove, and explore checked-in mutation controls with exact test names,
  separate build/test deadlines, and verified source and lockfile restoration.
